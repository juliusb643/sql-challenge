Module 9 SQL Challenge 

For this challenge I took the six provided CSV files, uploaded them into pgAdmin to figure out company data for a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard, and successfully queried the created tables and database. 

I used QuickDBD to create an Entity Relationship Diagram, which is listed as a PNG file in this repository. This visual helps to see the table columns, and see how they relate to each other in order to make queries more successful and faster. 

To create the tables, I used the schemata that we practiced in class and reviewed past class notes to create my tables. 

I then successfully imported all of the CSV files into their respective tables that I created, with no issue. 

To query the tables, I used my own knowledge as well as Xpert Learning Assistant to help refine and clean up my queries.
